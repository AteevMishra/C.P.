Sparse Table -

Time Complexity to Create - O(NlogN)
Answers queries in Time - O(logN)
NOTE** - function to answer queries can be modified to answer in time - O(1)

APPLICATION -----> (min/max/gcd of numbers) in a range

To be used when ----

1) No element in array is being changed or inserted, i.e, the original array is untouched or static . 
   If some queries change the array then don't use this technique, use Segment Tree.

2) Can be used on functions which are associative. Eg: To find min/max element in a range, or to find GCD of all elements in a range


TIP*** - If you have the choice to work on Sparse Table then work on them and don't use Segment Trees because constant factor of
Segment Trees is very high compared to Sparse Table
